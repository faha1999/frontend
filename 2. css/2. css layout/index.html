                <h1>Welcome to Our Site, Nice to See You Here</h1>

                <p>Passepartout was delighted.  His master's last exploit, the consequences of which he ignored, enchanted him.  Never had the crew seen so jolly and dexterous a fellow.  He formed warm friendships with the sailors, and amazed them with his acrobatic feats.  He thought they managed the vessel like gentlemen, and that the stokers fired up like heroes.  His loquacious good-humour infected everyone.</p>

                <p>He had forgotten the past, <a href="https://www.google.com" target="_blank">its vexations and delays</a>.  He only thought of the end, so nearly accomplished; and sometimes he boiled over with impatience, as if heated by the furnaces of the Henrietta.  Often, also, the worthy fellow revolved around Fix, looking at him with a keen, distrustful eye; but he did not speak to him, for their old intimacy no longer existed.</p>

                <p>Fix, it must be confessed, understood nothing of what was going on. The conquest of the Henrietta, the bribery of the crew, Fogg managing the boat like a skilled seaman, amazed and confused him.  He did not know what to think.</p>

                <h2>About Ourname</h2>

                <p>As for Captain Speedy, he continued to howl and growl in his cabin; and Passepartout, whose duty it was to carry him his meals, courageous as he was, took the greatest precautions.  Mr. Fogg did not seem even to know that there was a captain on board.</p>
